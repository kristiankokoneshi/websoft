<h2>S01</h2>
<p> <b> <u>Did you know before about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b> </u> </p>
  <p> Yes, except for GitHub Pages. We have used Git/ GitHub since the beginning of our programme for all our projects. I have heard of Markdown, but never used it. I have heard of that while researching in our Software Engineering 2 project.
  I didn’t know about GitHub Pages before. I knew it as a term but not their purpose or what to do with them.
</p>

<p> <b> <u>Have you ever created websites before?</b> </u> </p>
<p> Yes! During our Software Engineering 2 project I was part of the Unit Group and our task was to create an android app and a website. I was part of the subgroup dealing with the website.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b> </u> </p>
<p>We first learned about web application in our Software Engineering 2 course and our Network Application course. We worked with web servers and applications. We learned different API , like Restful API, for web servers and how to work with them. We also worked with Java servlets and with HTML to design our web applications. </p>

<p> <b> <u> What is your TIL for this course section?</b> </u> </p>
<p>My TIL was the GitHub Pages. I didn’t know much about them or how to work with them. Now I know a little bit more about them and what they do.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</b> </u> </p>
<p>Yes! During our Software Engineering 2 project I was part of the Unit Group and our task was to create an android app and a website. I was part of the subgroup dealing with the website.To build our website we used HTML and Css for the frontend and we used Javascript for the backend part of the website.</p>

<p> <b> <u> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b> </u> </p>
<p>HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved.HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.</p>
<p>CSS dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions.Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b> </u> </p>
<p>When we brows the internet, a web browser acts as a client that sends When we brows the internet, a web browser acts as a client that sends receives request, process it and sends back a respond to a client/web browser.</p>

<p> <b> <u>What is your TIL for this course section?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I have learnt how to set up my own GitHub page and how to style it using HTML and CSS.</p>
