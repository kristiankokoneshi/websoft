<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p> <b> <u>Did you know before about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b> </u> </p>
  <p> Yes, except for GitHub Pages. We have used Git/ GitHub since the beginning of our programme for all our projects. I have heard of Markdown, but never used it. I have heard of that while researching in our Software Engineering 2 project.
  I didn’t know about GitHub Pages before. I knew it as a term but not their purpose or what to do with them.
</p>

<p> <b> <u>Have you ever created websites before?</b> </u> </p>
<p> Yes! During our Software Engineering 2 project I was part of the Unit Group and our task was to create an android app and a website. I was part of the subgroup dealing with the website.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b> </u> </p>
<p>We first learned about web application in our Software Engineering 2 course and our Network Application course. We worked with web servers and applications. We learned different API , like Restful API, for web servers and how to work with them. We also worked with Java servlets and with HTML to design our web applications. </p>

<p> <b> <u> What is your TIL for this course section?</b> </u> </p>
<p>My TIL was the GitHub Pages. I didn’t know much about them or how to work with them. Now I know a little bit more about them and what they do.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>

<p> <b> <u>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</b> </u> </p>
<p>Yes! During our Software Engineering 2 project I was part of the Unit Group and our task was to create an android app and a website. I was part of the subgroup dealing with the website.To build our website we used HTML and Css for the frontend and we used Javascript for the backend part of the website.</p>

<p> <b> <u> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b> </u> </p>
<p>HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved.HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.</p>
<p>CSS dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions.Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b> </u> </p>
<p>When we brows the internet, a web browser acts as a client that sends When we brows the internet, a web browser acts as a client that sends receives request, process it and sends back a respond to a client/web browser.</p>

<p> <b> <u>What is your TIL for this course section?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I have learnt how to set up my own GitHub page and how to style it using HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>

<p> <b> <u>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</b> </u> </p>
<p>No! I haven't been working on client side javascript before.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</b> </u> </p>
<p>During my studies I have only worked with Java.  Both languages require the developer to code in terms of objects and their relationships to one another. By extension this gives both languages access to techniques like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Both languages can be used in aspects of front-end development. JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML, implemented as a framework or library; Java can be used as a Java applet. Both languages can be used on the server-side. Java has long been used to power back-end technologies like Apache, JBoss, and WebSphere. Node.js has become a launch pad for JavaScript-powered servers.</p>
<p>Java is considered a compiled programming language. JavaScript is considered an interpreted scripting language. The difference is in the implementation: Java is compiled into bytecode and run on a virtual machine, whereas JavaScript can be interpreted directly by a browser in the syntax it is written. Java uses static type checking, where the type of a variable is checked at compile-time. The programmer must specify the type (integer, double, string, etc.) of any variable they create. JavaScript, like most scripting languages, uses dynamic typing, where type safety is verified at runtime. It is not required for a programmer to specify the type of any variable they create. Java makes use of multiple threads to perform tasks in parallel. JavaScript, particularly as it exists as Node.js in server-side applications, handles concurrency on one main thread of execution via a queue system called the event loop, and a forking system called Node Clustering.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I followed the instructions given to us, as well as researching on my own about different concepts that I didn't know before, likeJavascript objects and interactive images. I aim for grade 5 and I think my code turned out to be good.  </p>

<p> <b> <u>What is your TIL for this course section?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I learned: </p>
<p>- how to make a dynamic website </p>
<p>- to work with JSON files in Javascript </p>
<p>- to work with Javascript object </p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p> <b> <u>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</b> </u> </p>
<p>I don't have any previous experience with node/npm before this assignment.  The only previous experience I have had is with Java.Java is an Object-Oriented language needs to be compiled and run inside JRE (Java Runtime Environment) whereas Node JS is a cross-platform runtime system and environment for applications written in JavaScript. Java is strictly a server-side language which has nothing to do with the browser, whereas Node JS can be used on client and server side efficiently. Java is heavily used for building complex web-based application with an already provided framework built using Java whereas Node JS is best suited for real-time collaborative drawing or editing applications like Google Docs.</p>

<p> <b> <u>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I feel this is a great experience and opportunity for me to learn new concepts in web development.</p>

<p> <b> <u>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</b> </u> </p>
</p>I have been reading lectures, documentation and code exaples at the coding forums. </p>

<p> <b> <u>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I am aiming for grade 5, and it was a bit difficult in the beginning.</p>

<p> <b> <u>What is your TIL for this course section?</b> </u> </p>
<p>I have learned how to set up EJS server and accept and respond to HTTP requests. I have also learned
       how to set up page dynamically using EJS template files.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p> <b> <u> What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages
    and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages? </b> </u> </p>
<p>In my opinion popularity depends on the key features of the language like security
    portability and versatility. It also depends on the state of tech industry.
</p>
<p> <b> <u>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages? </b> </u> </p>
<p>Depends on the project scale and type. For eneterprise project java is really good
    because of the security and portability accross multiple platforms etc.
</p>
<p> <b> <u>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com to customize your own comparison
     on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</b> </u> </p>

<p> <b> <u>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and
your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”? </b> </u> </p>
<p>I d explain the advantages of the given tech and show how and why should
    be utilized in the project </p>
<p> <b> <u>What is your TIL for this course section? </b> </u></p>
<p>I have learned that different tech problems require different tech to solve them</p>
